This document was created in June 2023 in an effort to consolidate all the various quest guide docs out there. Some quests have since been added to the game and no guide has been created for it yet. Some quests have been altered, rendering previous guides incorrect. If you happen to have a guide for a missing or altered quest and feel like helping, seek out Exosphere or Nils on discord.


A + next to the quest number means the walkthrough is confirmed to be working.
If you follow a guide listed below to the letter and it is not marked as confirmed, seek out Exosphere or Nils on discord. Obviously, we’d like to know if a guide is flat out wrong too! 


Enough chatter, enjoy the most thorough quest guide ever made below.

EXAMPLE:
> exa ael rannath
Ael Rannath looms majestically to the north, rising from the waters of Del Rimmon to tower at almost level altitude with this summit. Its tall cliffs are steep slopes upon which trees climb, mounting one head above another; and above them again are grey faces of inaccessible rock, crowned by a great spire of stone. The light from the beacon striking the tall island creates a dramatic effect - the shadow of Ael Rannath extends like a long finger over the waters of the lake, pointing toward the western cliffs.
> exa finger
A long shadow extends from the base of Ael Rannath to the western shores of the lake. The tip of the shadow has the resemblance of a great finger, and almost seems to be pointing at a specific location along the shoreline.
> exa location
The tip of the shadow which extends from Ael Rannath appears to be pointing directly at a large boulder which rests in the woods along the northwestern shore of the lake.

Tips and tricks!


The Bare Minimum 
<alias eg examine game> - use ‘eg’ every time you move on the field. 
fshoot - will attempt to score - you do not have to be right in front of the goal
         or even the same room to shoot (closer is better).
fcontrol - take control of the ball when no one else has it.


Journeyman Commands
ftackle - you attempt to tackle automatically when you enter a room with the ball
          carrier. You can only tackle a ball carrier. 
fkick <x> <y> - X is left or right on the field. Y is up and down on the field. 
          Example: fkick -2 -2  kicks southwest fkick 2 2 kicks northeast
fpass <d,l,r,a> - attempts to pass to a teammate. 
          If an opponent is in the direct line they can intercept.                                 
fpass <player> also works but figuring out who is where on the fly is a challenge.                                                        
examine scoreboard - not really needed but if you want to check.
ffkick / ffpass / ffshoot - will kick the ball even if the target is too far away.                                                        fshout <message> - does not work while play is underway.


Game Notes
<*> You are an * on the field.
<*> The ball is an o on the field.
<*> The goal is full north or full south, midfield east and west
<*> Use standard gen commands to move around the rooms (n,ne,e,se,s etc)
<*> When you are tackled or tackle someone, they are stunned briefly
<*> Other players are A, D, L, R -or- a, d, l, r
<*> A is the attacker, D the defender, L is left and R is right midfielder
        Anyone can attack or defend, the only real impact is where you start
        on the field after any score etc.
<*> Defend by standing in the room with the goal. You will automatically
        attempt to block shots. <ftackle> if someone walks in with the ball.
<*> At game start the direction you are going is announced. You will start
        on your goal side of the play field. Examine Game and the people on
        the same side as you are your teammates.
<*> Note if they are capital or lowercase letters.


Strategy Ideas
<*> The first 3 opponents are easy and are basically just practice / chance to learn.
<*> Multiple Attacker Strategy - with two+ people on the ball, if an opponent 
    tackles the ball away, another person can tackle the opponent immediately 
    to keep moving to the goal and shoot.
<*> At least one person should be in goal when an opponent shoots.
<*> <ffkick> to get the ball out of the goal as quickly as possible if you
    block a shot. <eg> ffkick 4 4 or ffkick -4 -4

You will have to place 10 ltr of volume on each of 4 locations, that means 1 heavy and 2 small stones.
!!! Try to do the above quickly – if you take too long you’ll hear a rushing sound and the stones will be swept away by water, and you’ll have to start over.
<*> (Shadows) e, 3d, w, exa shadows
You will see 4 shadows of 4 wedges and stone on wedges. For instance: shadow of second stone of ninth wedge. You will have to place total weight of more then 50kg on each stone. That means 2 heavy stones and something light(copper coin). So do place stone on <num> stone of <num> wedge until you hear click. Do this for every of 4 stones. After you done with all of 4 stones you will hear a clear ringing sound from the pedestal.

If you somehow block it and it cannot leave the room, it will stay for 10 seconds and then disappear. If the beast runs away into a dead end, it will stay there for 30 seconds and then disappear. 
The best way to kill the beast is trying to block exits from room somehow. If that is not possible, stand in the middle, wait until attacked and when the beast moves, go in the opposite direction and stand outside a dead end. Wait for another attack and then follow the beast into a dead end.
<*> When you finish off the beast, get the eye, return to the dragon and give eye to dragon.

Kill Thanarians in the Cathedral. Sometimes they drop 'important missive'. Collect unique missives till you have 4 with numbers on them. There are at least 10 unique missives, and you might find many duplicates. They HAVE to be from your kills so they have the correct numbers.
You can store the missives in a sack in-game, and return to gather more over several sessions. (They are destroyed on logout)
Once you have 4 missives with numbers, return to the priestess/Solara shrine.
Then you turn the dial to the numbers found (A-D)
<*> (Priestess) <turn left dial A>, <turn center left dial B>, <turn center right dial C>, <turn right dial D>
Below are 10 examples of missives. Note the numbers from those example missives to be used are 4, 11, 15, 68 in that order.

NOTE 3: Make sure you have the medallion from Violet. If not, then return to Violet and ask for another one.
Again examine the tiles and this time follow the tiles in the correct order that corresponds to the tapestries. Note the key features in the tiles and cross check with the tapestries to find the match. See 3 examples below.

10 Missive examples:
We found NOTHING. They must be there. We've seen far too much activity for the size of the Shrine.


We've had some success. We've tracked them to Wall street. Those damned Solarians must be trying to find it. We must stop them.


We've discoverd one number is 4. It took a lot of torture to get that number. The Solarian succumbed and it's all we could get.


It is as we feared. The Solarians have a stronghold somewhere in Kalad. We are searching for it and will let you know.


We are making little progress. We spy on what we believe are their sympathizers but with no luck. More soon we hope.


The next two numbers came at the cost of two more Solarians. Oh well. They sympathize with the Saurians. They deserve it. The numbers are 15 and 11.


It's as we feared. We've discovered they have a huge stronghold beneath the shrine. It has a a series of four dials requiring a code. We are working to decipher the code.


We were wrong. SO wrong. I do not know what we faced but we cannot defeat them yet. We must amass more power. Pray to Thanar we can destroy them before they find it.


Major discovery. They are hiding out beneath the last remaining shrine to Solara. We are searching the place tomorrow.


One of our patrols was ambushed and most were slaughtered by Saurians. Fortunately for us we found the last number. 68. We can wipe them out now!

3 Tapestries examples:
> x fourth tapestry
The fourth tapestry, located to the right of the middle one, is wide and long. It displays Kabal much more as you recognize it today. A Cathedral has been built, as has a Shrine, by the humans within Kabal. Only humans seem to enter the Cathedral, while all the other races, and some humans, attend the shrine. The tapestry depicts a brightly shining sun in the top right. It also displays a now large shade in the top left. Thick black threads emanate from the Cathedral towards various important looking buildings with Kabal. One such thread moves towards both the shade and the sun.
(The second path is emblazoned with a Sun in the upper right. A larger shade sits in the upper left of the image. The city below is large, much like Kabal today. Dark tendrils flow out from a large cathedral.)




> x fifth tapestry
This tapestry displays the sun, surrounded by a black thread from the citadel, shining more brightly than on any other tapestry. The shade that once loomed ominously is overtaken by the black encircled Sun and shrinks as you stare at it. You hear, first loudly, then softly a voice in your head 'Nameless' before it ceases altogether. Beneath in what is obviously the city of Kabal, black robed priests and priestesses stand side by side with others clad in gleaming white. Both sets have their arms outstretched towards the sky while other races of Kalad look on. Those in black are all human, while you see others, Saurians, Goblins, Elves, amongst the ranks of those clad in white.
(The third path is emblazoned with a Sun in the upper right corner. The sun is encircled with a black tendril. The sun shines brightly towards the shade which appears to be shrinking away to nothing.)




> x sixth tapestry
The final tapestry hangs on the wall through which you entered. It is the largest of them all. The sun shines still, but it has faded and appears to be diminished in some way. You feel, staring at the sun, that it has lost some of what it once was. The shade is gone, but the threads from the cathedral are thick and almost appear to pulse as you look at them. In the city proper, you see Saurians pushed into the wastes of Kalad by humans clad all in black. Other races are being put in cages, or whipped towards slave houses. The shrine where those in white could be seen is still present, but the white clad priests and priestesses from the previous tapestries are no longer visible. The city appears dark. Humans thrive, but the other races of Kalad do not.
(The fourth path is emblazoned with a sun in the right. The sun is present, but it is diminished in its light. Thick tendrils of black, like large snakes, reach towards all the important looking buildings in the city)








The end.
